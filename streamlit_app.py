# Focus on the FRUIT_NAME Column

# To use a Snowpark COLUMN function named "col" we need to import it
# into our app. We'll place the import statement close to where we plan
# to use it. This will make more sense for beginners as they will be able
# to see why we imported it and how it is used. In a later lab, we'll
# move it up with other import statements in order to show good code
# organization.

from snowflake.snowpark.functions import col

    """Choose the fruits you want in your custom Smoothie!

# option = st.selectbox(
#    "What is your favorite fruit?",
#    ("Banana", "Strawberries", "Peaches"),

# Display the full Fruit Options List from loaded database
# add .select(col('FRUIT_NAME')) to bring in only the 1 column
session = get_active_session()

# st.dataframe(data=my_dataframe, use_container_width=True)


# We are placing the multiselect entries into a variable called "ingredients."
# We can then write "ingredients" back out to the screen. Our ingredients variable
# is an object or data type called a LIST. So it's a list in the traditional sense
# of the word, but it is also a datatype or object called a LIST. A LIST is different
# than a DATAFRAME which is also different from a STRING!

# contained in our ingredients LIST. 
# top line really means 'if not null'; so we dont show empty brackets.

    # line below = "for each fruit_chosen in ingredients_list multiselect box: do 
    # everything below this line that is indented". We never defined a variable 
    # named fruit_chosen, but Python understands that whatever is placed in that
    # position is a counter for items in the list. So we could just as easily say: 
    # "for x in ingredients_list:" The += operator means "add this to what is already
    # in the variable" so each time the FOR Loop is repeated, a new fruit name is 
    # appended to the existing string.
    for fruit_chosen in ingredients_list:
        ingredients_string += fruit_chosen + ' '
    # Output the string. The st.write() command should be part of the IF block but
    # not part of the FOR Loop. You can try it as part of the FOR Loop and see an 
    # interesting result. In either case, you'll see that the result is going to need
    # some additional work. Don't worry, we'll make the string look a little better in
    # the next lab.
